In the image above, the script is ran, alongside the inspect element of the Nintendo webpage being scraped
In the output of my script, it says "Item Super Mario Bros Wonder has price Regular Price:"
I found that the price of $60 is on a different line, outside of the span that Inspecting the price element on the website gives me
Since it is on a line of its own, I am not sure how to get it to select that and give me the price of $60, rather than "Regular Price"

Any help here is appreciated! I ran into the same issue with the Rebok website. Thanks!
